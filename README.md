(Sultan Qaboos University, 2025).

## 📑 Abstract  

Medical image segmentation, the process of delineating anatomical structures and pathologies from CT and MRI, plays a vital role in clinical decision-making, surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. However, its accuracy is constrained by the scarcity of annotated datasets, since expert labeling is costly and labor-intensive. Transfer learning offers a promising solution by reusing pretrained models to reduce data requirements and improve generalization.  

This thesis addresses one of the most constrained scenarios: **when no pretrained models exist for the same organ or modality.** In such cases, cross-organ and cross-modality transfer becomes essential. We investigate the adaptation of knowledge from **brain tumor MRI** to **liver tumor CT** segmentation, thereby extending the benefits of transfer learning to settings of extreme data scarcity.  

To this end, we propose the **Adapted Dual-Encoder Shared-Tail U-Net (ADEST-U-Net)**, a hybrid architecture with two complementary encoders:  
- One initialized with **MRI-pretrained weights** (from brain tumor segmentation).  
- One trained from scratch on **liver CT**.  

The encoder features are concatenated, refined via shared convolutional blocks, and decoded into tumor masks, enabling effective **cross-domain feature alignment**.  

**Key findings**:  
- ADEST-U-Net achieved a **Dice score of 0.7189**, outperforming both scratch-trained UNet++ (+1.7 points) and MRI-pretrained UNet++ (+18.0 points).  
- Reduced false positives significantly (−67.6% vs. baseline UNet++, −40.4% vs. fine-tuned UNet++).  
- Qualitative results showed predictions were better confined to the liver parenchyma, avoiding invalid extrahepatic detections.  

**Limitations**:  
- Difficulty detecting very small tumors.  
- Large performance drop in cross-dataset evaluation (SQUH vs. 3DIRCADb-01), revealing sensitivity to scanner types, protocols, and annotation style.  
- No lesion-wise analysis was performed, so weaknesses in small-lesion detection may be underestimated.

## ⚙️ Workflow  

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Use `preparation_and_processing.ipynb` if starting from raw data.  
   - Or directly load processed slices.  

2. **Baseline (Track 1)** – UNet++ trained from scratch.  
3. **Fine-Tuning (Track 2)** – UNet++ initialized with **brain MRI weights**.  
   - Pretrained weights from [UNet++ Brain Tumor Segmentation Repo](https://github.com/sauravmishra1710/UNet-Plus-Plus---Brain-Tumor-Segmentation).  
4. **Proposed (Track 3)** – ADEST-U-Net with dual encoders (MRI-pretrained + CT-specific).  
5. **Evaluation** – Quantitative (Dice, IoU) and qualitative (visual overlays).  
6. **Ablation Studies** – Component-level analysis.

## 💾 Model Weights  

The trained model weights for this project are available on Google Drive:  

🔗 [Download Model Weights (best_models_weights.rar)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/184IwcG1Bm5M8UFOJJ-tOeZqVi7Ue2mmg)  

⚠️ Note: Model weights are not included in this repository due to GitHub’s 100 MB file size limit.  
Please download them from the above link and place them inside the `models_weights/` folder before running evaluation notebooks.  


## 🏥 Clinical Implications  

- Can serve as a **pre-annotation tool** to reduce radiologists’ manual effort.  
- Produces **consistent, reproducible tumor contours** → reduces inter-observer variability.  
- Potential for **integration into PACS** for real-time overlays.  
- Valuable for **multidisciplinary tumor boards**, enabling faster disease-burden visualization.  
- Limitations acknowledged:  
  - Weakness on **small lesions** (need lesion-wise metrics in future).  
  - Domain shifts (scanner/annotation differences) → performance drops.  
  - Future work: advanced **domain adaptation**, **size-aware losses**, and **multi-scale refinements**.

## 📊 Results & Visualizations

Below are sample figures generated during the experiments:

### Data Augmentation

The repository also provides **sample qualitative results** comparing the three experimental tracks:  

- **Track 1 (Scratch, UNet++)** – baseline trained directly on liver CT.  
- **Track 2 (Cross-organ + modality adaptation, UNet++)** – pretrained on brain MRI with modality adapter.  
- **Track 3 (ADEST-U-Net, proposed)** – dual-encoder architecture integrating MRI-pretrained features with CT-specific learning.  

These visualizations show CT slices (left), their ground-truth masks, and segmentation predictions from each track.  
They highlight that **ADEST-U-Net (Track 3)** improves tumor boundary delineation and reduces false positives compared to baseline models.
